# Obsidian Forms and Dashboards Plugin
## Purpose
This plugin is only intended to implement some of the ideas I have already made with dataview scripts. While there are plugins that already exist and implement these ideas, they don't quite do what I specifically want.

I may also try to use this plugin like a collection of scripts that can be executed in their own code blocks, and maybe even turn this into a way of having custom named code blocks (if that's even possible)
